= gdk-core

This is the core library used by the CLI and REST API. It primarily depends on the Micronaut `io.micronaut.starter:micronaut-starter-api` library.

== Determining features

Most features are selectable, but "service" features (under package `cloud.graal.gdk.feature.service`) which represent Micronaut/Oracle supported features will replace standard features to add additional GDK functionality.

In addition, when users choose clouds, there are "create" features (under package `cloud.graal.gdk.feature.create`) that represent those and add functionality to the cloud-specific project modules.

There is a "create" feature for each combination of cloud and project type, e.g., `GdkAwsCloudApp` for `create-app` with AWS or `GdkGcpCloudFunction` for `create-function` with GCP.

There is a "service" feature for each combination of cloud and service type, e.g., `OciEmail` for OCI and email or `AzureStreaming` for Azure and streaming.

Based on the user's selection of clouds and services, the corresponding GDK "create" and "service" features are added to the collection of user-selected features for generating the apps.

The "create" features build an application or function for the corresponding cloud. Most of the work will be in the base class (e.g., `AbstractGdkCloudApp`) with any required cloud-specific customizations being done in the feature class.

The "create" features are only responsible for generating content that's not related to any selected services. The "service" features handle those changes.

Generally the "service" features delegate to existing micronaut-starter features. For example `OciSecretManagement` currently just dependency-injects the `io.micronaut.starter.feature.oraclecloud.OracleCloudVault` feature (which is what's selected in starter if you select `oracle-cloud-secretmanagement`) which does the real work.

== GdkProjectGenerator

The primary difference between `GdkProjectGenerator` and `io.micronaut.starter.application.generator.DefaultProjectGenerator` from micronaut-starter is the partitioning of work. Some support for multi-module builds was added recently to micronaut-starter to support AWS CDK, but most of the library still runs under the assumption that a single application will be created.

`GdkGeneratorContext` helps with this partitioning. It extends the default `io.micronaut.starter.application.generator.GeneratorContext` and supports various states that determine which config settings and dependencies are "active".

Features make their changes when their `apply(GdkGeneratorContext)` method is called, and they make application or bootstrap config changes by calling `GeneratorContext.getConfiguration()` / `GeneratorContext.getBootstrapConfiguration()`, and register dependencies via `GeneratorContext.addDependency()`.

`GdkProjectGenerator` sets the "cloud" to `NONE` initially when generating the "lib" module, then sets the "cloud" from each cloud module. This way `GdkGeneratorContext` knows which configuration or dependency context to use to separate out cloud-specific config and dependencies.

== Rocker templates

The project has support for Rocker templates to generate application source code and other files. Template files must end in `.rocker.raw` and can be in any package under `src/main/java`, but the current convention is to keep templates with the features that use them in a `template` folder, e.g., see the templates used by the "database" service in `src/main/java/cloud/graal/gdk/feature/service/database/template`.

The build is configured to regenerate Java source for the templates in `build/generated/rocker` before compiling; the generated Java source files are compiled with the main project source.
